				Pushing to a Remote
Pushing to a remote is when you add your contributions to a different project. This means merging your branch with one of the ones on their project. You have to have the correct permissions to do this. For instance, I wasn't able to push my changes to the BSMRKRS/gitpractice at first because I hadn't been invited as a contributor.
