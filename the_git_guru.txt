Q: When can I push to master?
A: Someone will always be in charge of the master branch. It may be the repository owner; in big organizations, someone's job will be ensuring that master is always in working order. So unless you're the person in charge of master, don't push to it without permission.

Q: Are master and origin the same thing?
A:

this is jordan! I don't like this.
What's up?
